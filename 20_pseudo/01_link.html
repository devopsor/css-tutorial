    CSS Pseudo-classes (pseudo-classes)
    CSS pseudo-class selectors match components based on other criteria, not necessarily defined by the document tree. 
    CSS pseudo-classes are keywords added to selectors that specify special states for elements to be selected. 
    For example, :hover can be used to change the color of a button when the user hovers over it.

    What is a pseudo-class
    CSS pseudo-classes allow you to style dynamic states of elements, such as hover, active, and focus states, 
    and elements that are already in the document tree but cannot be targeted by using other selectors, 
    without adding any selectors to their IDs or class, for example, for the first or last child element.

    Pseudo-classes start with a colon (:). Its syntax can be given by:

    selector: pseudo-class { property : value ; }

    The following sections describe the most commonly used pseudo-classes.

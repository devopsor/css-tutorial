<!-- 
    ::before and ::after pseudo-elements
    The ::before and ::after pseudo-elements can be used to insert generated content before or after the content of an element. 
    The content CSS property inserts the generated content when used in conjunction with these pseudo-elements.

    This is useful for further embellishing content-rich elements that shouldn't be part of the actual markup of the page. 
    You can use these pseudo-elements to insert regular strings or to embed objects (such as images) and other resources.

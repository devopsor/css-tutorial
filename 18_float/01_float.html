    CSS Float
    The CSS float property specifies whether the box should float. 
    The float property in CSS is a positioning property. It is used to push an element to the left or right, 
    allowing other elements to wrap around it, typically used for images and layouts.   

    CSS floating elements
    You can float elements to the left or right, but only for elements that produce boxes that are not absolutely positioned . Any element that follows the floated element will flow around the floated element on the other side.
    The float property may have one of three values:
    left:The element floats to the left of its containing block.
    right:The element floats to the right of its containing block.
    none:Remove the float attribute from the element.
    initial:It sets the property to its initial value.
    inherit:It is used to inherit this property from its parent element.

    CSS Overflow
    The overflow property specifies the behavior that occurs when an element's content overflows (does not fit) into the element's box.

    Handling overflow content
    The content of the element may be larger than the size of the box itself. For example, 
    the given width and height properties do not allow enough space to hold the element's content.

    The CSS overflow property lets you specify whether to clip content, render scroll bars, 
    or display overflow content for block-level elements.

    This property can have one of the following values: 
        visible: Defaults. The content is not clipped; it is rendered outside the element's box, so it may overlap other content.
        hidden:The content of the overflow element box will be clipped and the rest of the content will not be visible.
        scroll: The overflowed content is clipped as if hidden, but a scrolling mechanism is provided to access the overflowed content.
        auto:If the content overflows the element's box, it will automatically provide a scrollbar to view the rest of the content, 
                otherwise the scrollbar will not appear.
    CSS3 also defines the overflow-x and overflow-y properties to allow independent control of vertical and horizontal clipping.

CSS3 multi-column layout
With CSS3, you can split the text content of an element into multiple columns.

Create a multi-column layout
CSS3 introduced the multi-column layout module for creating multiple-column layouts in an easy and efficient way. 
Now you can create layouts like those you see in magazines and newspapers without using floating boxes. 
Here's a simple example of splitting some text into three columns using CSS3's multi-column layout feature.

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>CSS3 Multiple Columns</title>
    <style>
        p {
            /* Chrome, Safari, Opera */
            -webkit-column-count: 3;
            -webkit-column-gap: 100px;
            -webkit-column-rule: 2px solid red;
            /* Firefox */
            -moz-column-count: 3;
            -moz-column-gap: 100px;
            -moz-column-rule: 2px solid red;
            /* Standard syntax */
            column-count: 3;
            column-gap: 100px;
            column-rule: 2px solid red;
        }
    </style>
</head>

    <p> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in
        HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered
        on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

        CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C
        specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which
        allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3.
        There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version number.

        After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS modules
        started to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations separately per
        module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable
        state of the CSS specification and individual modules progress. CSS modules now have version numbers, or levels,
        such as CSS Color Module Level 5. </p>

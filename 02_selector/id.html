    CSS selectors
    A CSS selector is a pattern used to match elements in an HTML document. 
    The associated style rules will be applied to elements matching the selector pattern.

    What is a selector
    Selectors are one of the most important aspects of CSS because they are used to select elements on 
    a web page so that they can be styled. You can define selectors in several ways.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <style>

        /* ID selector */
        #error {
            color: red;
        }

    </style>
</head>

<body>

    <!-- 
        ID selector
        The id selector is used to define style rules for single or unique elements.
        The definition of an ID selector is a pound sign ( #) followed by an ID value.

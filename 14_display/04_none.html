<!-- 
    Do not display (none)
    When the display property value is none, the element does not generate any box at all, and does not display on the page. 
    Child elements also don't generate any boxes, even if their display property is set to not. 
    The document is rendered as if the element does not exist in the document tree.

    Note: A display property value of none does not create an invisible box - it does not generate any boxes. 
    It also does not reserve its physical space for the hidden object, that is, the object disappears completely on the page, 
    and is generally invisible and untouchable. See the live demo given in the Visibility and Display section.

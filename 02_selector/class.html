    A CSS selector is a pattern used to match elements in an HTML document. 
    The associated style rules will be applied to elements matching the selector pattern.

    Selectors are one of the most important aspects of CSS because they are used to select elements on 
    a web page so that they can be styled. You can define selectors in several ways.

    CSS Fonts
    CSS font properties allow you to set various styles for the font, such as the font family, size and boldness of the text, variants, etc.

    Font properties
    The CSS style provides several properties for the font of the text content, such as: font-family, font-style, font-variant, 
    font-weightand font-size. The next section will introduce these properties one by one.

    Note: If the name of the font family is more than one word, it must be enclosed in quotation marks, 
    like "Times New Roman", "Courier New", "Trebuchet MS"etc.

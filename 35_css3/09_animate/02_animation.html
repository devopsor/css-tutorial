CSS3 Animations
CSS3 animation features allow you to create keyframe animations.

Create CSS3 animations
In the previous chapter, you have seen how to perform simple animations such as animating a property from one value to another with CSS3 transitions. 
However, CSS3 transitions have little control over how animations progress over time.

CSS3 animation goes one step further with keyframe-based animation, allowing you to specify changes in CSS properties 
over time as a set of keyframes, such as Flash animations.

Creating CSS animations is a two-step process, as shown in the following example:

The first step in building CSS animations is to define individual keyframes and use the keyframe declaration to name the animation.

The second step is to use the animation-name property to refer to the keyframe by name, and add animation-duration and 
other optional animation properties to specify the behavior of the animation.

However, it is not necessary to define keyframe rules before referencing or applying them. 
The following example will show you how to use CSS3 animation features to animate a <div> box horizontally from one position to another.

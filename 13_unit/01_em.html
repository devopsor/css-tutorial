    CSS Units
    Units are used to specify non-zero length values ​​in CSS properties. Commonly used units in CSS are: px, em, pt, percentage (%), etc.

    Understanding CSS Units
    Units for measuring length can be absolute units, such as pixels, points, etc., or relative units, such as percent (%) and em units.

    A non-zero value must specify CSS units, as there is no default unit. Missing or omitting a unit will be treated as an error. 
    However, if the value is 0, the unit can be omitted (after all, zero pixels and zero inches are the same measurement).

    Use the z-index property to stack elements in layers
    HTML pages are often considered two-dimensional pages because text, images, and other elements are 
    arranged on the page without overlapping. 
    However, in addition to their horizontal and vertical positions, you can also use the CSS z-index property to 
    stack boxes along the z-axis, i.e. one on top of the other. 
    This property specifies a box whose stacking horizontal position value is one of absolute, fixed, or relative.

    The z-position of each layer is represented as an integer representing the stacking order of the rendering. 
    Elements with larger z-index overlap with lower elements.

    A z-index property can help you create more complex web page layouts. 
    Below is an example showing how to create layers in CSS.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Use the z-index property to stack elements in layers</title>
    <style>
        .box {
            width: 150px;
            height: 150px;
            opacity: 0.9;
            position: absolute;
            top: 30px;
            left: 30px;
        }

        .red {
            background: #ff0000;
            z-index: 1;
        }

        .green {
            background: #00ff00;
            z-index: 2;
        }

        .blue {
            background: #0000ff;
            z-index: 3;
        }
    </style>
</head>

    <div class="box red">

            <div class="box blue"></div>

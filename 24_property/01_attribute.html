    CSS property selector
    Attribute selectors style HTML elements with specified attributes. You can style HTML elements with specified attributes, not just class and id attributes.

    Understanding attribute selectors
    CSS attribute selectors provide a simple and powerful way to apply styles to HTML elements based on the presence of a specific attribute or attribute value .

    You create attribute selectors by enclosing the attribute (optionally with a value) in a pair of square brackets. You can also put an element type selector in front of it .
    The following sections describe the most common attribute selectors.

    CSS [attribute] selector
    This is the simplest form of an attribute selector, which applies style rules to the element if the given attribute exists. 
    for example, we could style all elements with the title attribute using the following style rules:
 -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>CSS Attribute selector example</title>
    <style>
        [title] {
            color: blue;
        }

        abbr[title] {
            color: red;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <h1 title="heading">Attribute selector </h1>
    <p title="paragraph">The color of this paragraph will be blue.</p>
    <div title="paragraph">The color of this div will be blue.</div>
    <p><abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>is the publishing language of the World Wide Web</p>

</body>

<!-- 
    Group Selector
    Multiple selectors in a style sheet often share the same style rule declaration. 
    You can group them into a comma-separated list to minimize code in your stylesheet. 
    It also prevents you from repeating the same style rules over and over.
    As you can see in the example above, the same style rules font-weight: normal;are shared by select h1, h2 and h3. 
    So it can be split into comma separated lists like this:
 -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <style>
        h1,
        h2,
        h3 {
            font-weight: 600;
        }

        h1 {
            font-size: 36px;

        }

        h2 {
            font-size: 28px;
        }

        h3 {
            font-size: 22px;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>This is a h1 title </h1>
    <h2>This is a h2 title </h2>
    <h3>This is a h3 title </h3>

</body>

</html>

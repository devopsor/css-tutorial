CSS3 Shadows
With CSS3, you can apply shadows to elements.

Use CSS3 shadows
CSS3 enables you to add shadow effects to elements like in Photoshop without using any images. 
Before CSS3, sliced ​​images were used to create shadows around very annoying elements.

CSS3 box-shadow property
The box-shadow property can be used to add a shadow to an element's box. 
You can even apply multiple shadow effects using a comma-separated list of shadows. The basic syntax for creating box shadows can be given by:
    box-shadow : offset-x offset-y blur-radius color;

Components of the box-shadow property have the following meanings:
    offset-x — Sets the horizontal offset of the shadow.
    offset-y — Sets the vertical offset of the shadow.
    blur-radius — Sets the blur radius. The larger the value, the greater the blur, and the more blurred the edges of 
                            the shadow. Negative values ​​are not allowed.
    color — Sets the color of the shadow. If a color value is omitted or not specified, it will take the value of the color property.

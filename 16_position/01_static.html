    CSS Position
    The CSS position property is used to specify how elements are positioned on the page. 
    There are several CSS Position (positioning) methods: static, absolute, relative, and fixed.

    CSS positioning method
    Proper positioning of elements on a web page is necessary for good layout design. 
    There are several methods in CSS that can be used to position elements. 
    The next section will introduce these positioning methods one by one.

    Static positioning (static)
    Statically positioned elements are always positioned according to the normal flow of the page. 
    HTML elements are in a static position by default. Statically positioned elements are 
    not affected by the top , bottom , left , right , and z-index properties.

    If you don't specify an element's position attribute value, that is, by default, the element is statically positioned. 
    As long as it is an html object that supports the position attribute, it is static by default. static is the default value of the position property, 
    which means that the block remains where it should be and will not be repositioned.
    To put it bluntly, we usually don't use "position:static" at all, but sometimes when we use javascript to control element positioning, 
    if we want to make other positioning elements into static positioning, we must use "position:static" ;"to fulfill.

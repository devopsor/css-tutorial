    CSS Links
    A link or hyperlink is a link from one web resource page to another web resource page.

    CSS style link
    Links have four different states - link, visited, active and hover. These four states of a link or hyperlink can be styled differently through 
    CSS properties using the anchor element's pseudo-class , depending on which state they are in.
    This is a CSS pseudo-class associated with the HTML <a> tag and can be used to define different styles for different states of a hyperlink.
        a:link — Styles a normal or unvisited link without the mouse pointer.
        a:visited - Styles links that the user has visited without the mouse pointer.
        a:hover — Styles the link when the user places the mouse pointer over the link.
        a:active - Styles the link being clicked.

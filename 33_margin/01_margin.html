    what is a box model
    Each element that can be displayed contains one or more rectangular boxes. 
    The CSS box model generally describes how these rectangular boxes are laid out on a web page. 
    The boxes can have different properties and interact with each other in different ways, 
    but each box has a content area and optional surrounding margins, margins, and borders.

    The image below demonstrates how the margin, padding, and border CSS properties 
    determine how much space an element can take up on a web page.

    the width and height of the element
    Usually, when you use the CSS width and height properties to set the width and height of an element, 
    you are really just setting the width and height of the element's content area. 
    The actual width and height of the element box depends on several factors.

    CSS Margin (Margin)
    Margins clear the area around the border, separating it from other boxes.

    CSS Margin Properties
    The CSS margin properties allow you to set the margins on the sides of an element's box. 
    The margin has no background-color , it is completely transparent.

    Set the margins for each side
    You can easily specify different margins for different sides of an element (for example, top, right, bottom, or left) 
    using the CSS individual margin properties.

    CSS Outline
    An outline is a line drawn outside the border edge of an element (such as a button, active form field, etc.) to make it stand out.

    Outline VS Border
    Outlines are often used to highlight elements. Outlines look very similar to borders at first glance, but differ from borders in the following ways:
    Outlines take up no space because they are always placed on top of the element box, which can cause them to overlap other elements on the page.
    Unlike borders, outlines do not allow us to set each edge to a different width, nor can we set each edge to a different color and style. 
    The silhouette is the same in all respects.
    Outlines have no effect on surrounding elements other than overlapping.
    Unlike borders, outlines do not change the size or position of an element.
    Outlines may not be rectangular.
    Note: If you put an outline on an element, it will take up the same space on the web page as if you had no outline for that element.

    The outline-width property specifies the width of the outline to be added to the element. 
    Its value should be a CSS length (px, pt, em, etc.) or one of the allowed keywords, 
    but percentages or negative values ​​are not allowed. Just like the border-width property.

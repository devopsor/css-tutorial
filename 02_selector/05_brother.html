<!-- 
    Universal Brother Selector
    The generic sibling selector is similar to the adjacent sibling selector (E1+E2), but is less strict. 
    A generic sibling selector consists of two simple selectors âˆ¼separated by a tilde ( ) character. 
    It can be written like this: E1~E2, where E2 is the target of the selector.

<!-- 
    CSS Dimension (size)
    CSS size properties to control the height and width of an element.

    CSS size property
    The CSS provides several properties, such as width, height, max-width and max-height, etc., 
    that can give you the size of the Box. The next section describes how to use these properties to 
    create better web page layouts.

    Width and Height properties
    The width and height properties define the width and height of an element's content area. 
    This width and height do not include padding, borders or margins. See CSS Box Model  
     for how effective width and height are calculated.

    The width and height properties can take a length value (like px, pt, em, etc.), a percentage , 
    or the keyword auto. Negative length values ​​are not allowed.

    Note: The special auto value allows the browser to automatically calculate the width for the specified element. 
    The percentage (%) value refers to the width of the element's containing block.

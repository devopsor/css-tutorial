    CSS property selector
    Attribute selectors style HTML elements with specified attributes. You can style HTML elements with specified attributes, not just class and id attributes.

    Understanding attribute selectors
    CSS attribute selectors provide a simple and powerful way to apply styles to HTML elements based on the presence of a specific attribute or attribute value .

    You create attribute selectors by enclosing the attribute (optionally with a value) in a pair of square brackets. You can also put an element type selector in front of it .
    The following sections describe the most common attribute selectors.

    CSS [attribute] selector
    This is the simplest form of an attribute selector, which applies style rules to the element if the given attribute exists. 
    for example, we could style all elements with the title attribute using the following style rules:

    CSS [attribute~="value"] selector
    You can use the ~= operator to make an attribute selector match any element whose attribute value is 
    a list of space-separated values ​​(such as class="alert warning"), one of which is equal to the specified value:

    This selector matches any HTML element that has a class attribute containing space-separated values, 
    one of which is warning. For example, it matches elements with class value warning, alert warning, etc.

    CSS3 Gradients
    The CSS3 gradient feature allows you to create gradients from one color to another without using any images.

    Use CSS3 gradients
    The CSS3 gradient feature provides a flexible solution to generate smooth transitions between two or more colors. 
    To achieve this effect, we had to use images. Using CSS3 gradients reduces download time and saves bandwidth usage. 
    Gradient elements can be scaled up or down to any degree without loss of quality, 
    and the output will render faster because it is generated by the browser.

    Gradients come in two styles: linear and radial .

    Creating CSS3 Linear Gradients (linear)
    To create a linear gradient, you must define at least two color stops. 
    However, to create more complex gradients, you can define more color stops. 
    The color stop is the color you want to render a smooth transition. 
    You can also set the starting point and direction (or angle) to apply the gradient effect. 
    The basic syntax for creating linear gradients using keywords can be given by:

    linear-gradient(angle,  color -stop1,  color -stop2, ...)

    Linear Gradient - Left to Right
The following example will create a linear gradient from left to right.

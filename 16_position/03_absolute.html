<!-- 
    Absolute positioning (absolute)
    Absolutely positioned elements are positioned relative to the first parent element with a non-static position. 
    If no such element is found, it is placed on the page relative to the "top left" of the browser window. 
    The offset of the box is further specified using one or more of the properties top, right, bottom, and left.

    Absolutely positioned elements are completely removed from the normal flow, so they don't take up space when sibling elements are placed. 
    However, depending on the z-index property value, it can overlap other elements. 
    Also, absolutely positioned elements can have margins , and they don't collapse with any other margins.

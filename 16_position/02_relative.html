    CSS Position
    Relative positioning (relative)
    Relatively positioned elements are positioned relative to their normal position.

    In a relative positioning scheme, the box position of an element is calculated according to the normal flow. 
    Then move the box from that normal position depending on the properties - top or bottom and/or left or right.

    CSS Sprites (Sprites)
    The CSS Sprites technique is a method of reducing the number of HTTP requests made to image resources by combining images into a single file.

    What is a sprite sheet
    A sprite is a two-dimensional image that consists of combining small images into one large image at defined X and Y coordinates.

    To display a single image within a combined image, you can define the exact position of the image to display by using the CSS background-position property.

    Advantages of using CSS Image Sprite
    Web pages with many images, especially many small ones (e.g. icons, buttons, etc.) can take a long time to load and generate multiple server requests.

    Using image sprites instead of individual images will greatly reduce the number of HTTP requests the browser makes to the server, 
    which is very effective in reducing the load time of web pages and the overall performance of the site.

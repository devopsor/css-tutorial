<!-- 
    Use the float property for left and right alignment
    The CSS float property can be used to align to the left or right of its containing block's element in such a way that 
    other content can flow along its side.

    So if an element floats to the left, the content will flow along its right. Conversely, if the element floats to the right, 
    the content will flow along its left.

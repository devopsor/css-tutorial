    CSS3 box-sizing
    With CSS3 box sizing, you can specify the effective width of an element.

    Redefine box width with box-sizing
    By default, the actual width or height of the element's box visible/rendered on the web page depends on its width or height , 
    padding and border property values. For example, if you apply some padding and borders to a <div> element with a width of 100% , 
    the horizontal scroll bar will appear, as shown in the example below.

    <div class="box"> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a
        document written in
        HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered
        on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

        CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C
        specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which
        allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3.
        There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version number.

        After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS modules
        started to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations separately per
        module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable
        state of the CSS specification and individual modules progress. CSS modules now have version numbers, or levels,
        such as CSS Color Module Level 5. </div>

    Control table layout
    By default, tables expand and contract to accommodate the data they contain. 
    As data populates the table, the data continues to expand as long as there is room. 
    However, sometimes it is necessary to set a fixed width for the table to manage the layout.

    You can do this with the help of the CSS table-layout property. 
    This property defines the algorithm used to lay out table cells, rows and columns. 
    This property takes one of two values:
        auto â€” Use the automatic table layout algorithm. Using this algorithm,
                    the width of the table and its cells can be adjusted to fit the content. This is the default value.
        fixed - use the fixed table layout algorithm. Using this algorithm, the horizontal layout of the table does not depend on 
                    the contents of the cells; it only depends on the width of the table, 
                    the width of the columns, and the spacing of borders or cells.
    In the example below, the style rule indicates that the table is laid out using the fixed layout algorithm and 
    has a fixed width of 300 pixels.

    Without a fixed value for this table-layout attribute, on large tables, the user will not see any part of 
    the table until the browser has rendered the entire table.

    Tip: You can optimize table rendering performance by specifying the table-layout property. 
    A fixed value for this property causes the table to render one row at a time, providing faster information to the user.

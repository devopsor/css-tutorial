    CSS Pseudo-elements (pseudo-elements)
    The CSS Pseudo-elements pseudo-element is a keyword appended to the end of a selector that 
    allows you to style specific parts of the selected element. 
    Note: In contrast to pseudo-elements, pseudo-classes can change element styles based on state.

    CSS pseudo-elements are a way to style document elements that are not explicitly defined by their position in the document tree.

    What are pseudo-elements
    CSS pseudo-elements allow you to style an element or part of an element without adding any IDs or classes to it. 
    This is useful when you only want to style the first letter of a paragraph to create a drop cap effect, 
    or when you just want to insert some content before or after an element via a stylesheet, etc.

    CSS3 introduced a new double colon (::) syntax for pseudo-elements to distinguish pseudo-elements from pseudo-classes. 
    The new syntax for pseudo-elements can be given by:

        selector::pseudo-element{ property : value ; }

    These are the following most commonly used pseudo-elements:

    ::first-line first-line pseudo-element
        The ::first-line pseudo-element applies special styling to the first line of text.
        The style rule in the following example formats the first line of text in a paragraph. 
        The length of the first line depends on the size of the browser window or containing element.

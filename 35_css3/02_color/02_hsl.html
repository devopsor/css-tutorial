    HSL color value
    Colors can also be defined as HSL models (hue-saturation-lightness) using the hsl() function notation. 
    Hue is expressed as the angle (from 0 to 360) of a color wheel or circle (i.e. a rainbow represented by a circle). 
    The angle is given in fewer units because the angle is usually measured in degrees, so that the unit is implicit in CSS.

Saturation and brightness are expressed as percentages. 100% saturation means full color, and 0% is a shade of gray. 
However, 100% brightness is white, 0% brightness is black, and 50% brightness is normal. Check out the following examples:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>CSS HSL Color Values</title>
    <style>
        h1 {
            color: hsl(360, 70%, 60%);
        }

        p {
            background-color: hsl(480, 50%, 80%);
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>This is a header</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>

    CSS selectors
    A CSS selector is a pattern used to match elements in an HTML document. 
    The associated style rules will be applied to elements matching the selector pattern.

    What is a selector
    Selectors are one of the most important aspects of CSS because they are used to select elements on 
    a web page so that they can be styled. You can define selectors in several ways.

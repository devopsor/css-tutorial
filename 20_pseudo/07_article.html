    :Pseudo-elements and CSS classes
    Often, we only need to use these pseudo- elements to style a paragraph or other block-level element of text. 
    There, declaring a class to the pseudo-element does the trick. 
    Pseudo-elements can be combined with CSS classes to have effects, especially for elements with that class.

    The style rule in the following example will display the first letter of all paragraphs, class="article", in green, and a size of xx-large.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Pseudo-elements and CSS classes</title>
    <style>
        p.article::first-letter {
            color: #00ff00;
            font-size: xx-large;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <p class="article">This a sample article.</p>
    <p>This a normal paragraph.</p>
</body>

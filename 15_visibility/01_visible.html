    CSS Visibility vs Display
    The CSS display and visibility properties may seem like the same thing, 
    but they are actually quite different and often confuse the new features of web development.

    visibility: hidden; hides the element, but it still takes up space in the layout. 
    If the visibility of the hidden box's child elements is set to "visible", they will be visible.

    display: none; turns off display and completely removes the element from the document. 
    Even though its HTML is still in the source code, it doesn't take up any space. 
    Even if all child elements have their display property set to none, their display will be turned off.


    It can be seen from the above that although both the Visibility and Display properties can hide an element, 
    the difference between them is that visibility: hidden hides an element while still retaining the required space for the element on the page, 
    while display: none It behaves as if the element is removed from the page, and the element cannot be seen on the page.
    In addition, the difference between display: block and display: inline is that the block element will occupy a single line in the page, 
    while the inline element will not. Some objects default to block elements, while others default to inline elements. 
    You need to use them when you use them. Take care to prevent duplicate definitions of the same properties.

    When to use the Visibility or Display property
    Although both the Visibility and Display properties can achieve the purpose of hiding page elements, 
    the difference between them is how to respond to the normal document flow.
    If you want to hide an element but keep space for that element on the page, you should use visibility: hidden . 
    You should use display: none if you want to hide an element while leaving other content blank.

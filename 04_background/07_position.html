            Background property shorthand
            As you can see from the example above, there are many properties to consider when dealing with the background. 
            It is also possible to specify all of these properties in one property to shorten the code. This is called a shorthand property.
            Using shorthand notation, the above example can be written as:

            background : color image repeats the subordinate position ;
            
        */
        body {
            background: #f0e68c url("image/bg.jpg") no-repeat fixed 250px 25px ;
        }

        h1,
        p {
            margin-left: 150px;
        }
    </style>

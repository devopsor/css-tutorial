    CSS @media (media)
    CSS media types allow you to format documents so that they display correctly on various types of media (such as screen, print, auditory browsers, etc.).

    Introduction to Media Types
    CSS @media (media) is one of the most important features of style sheets, you can specify separate style sheets for different media types. 
    This is one of the best ways to build printer friendly web pages - just assign a different stylesheet to the "print" media type.
    Some CSS properties only work with certain media. For example, the page-break-after property only applies to paged media. 
    However, there are several properties that can be shared by different media types, but may require different values ​​for that property. 
    The font-size property is available for screen and print media, for example, but may have different values.

    Documents often require larger fonts on computer screens than on computer screens for better readability, 
    and sans serif fonts are also considered easier to read on screen, while serif fonts are in print very popular. 
    Therefore, a style sheet or set of style rules must be specified to apply to certain media types.

    Create media-dependent style sheets
    There are generally three methods used to specify media dependencies for style sheets:

    Method 1: Use the @media rule
    The @media rule is used to define different style rules for different media types in a single stylesheet. 
    Typically, this is followed by a comma-separated list of media types and a CSS declaration block containing style rules for the target media.

    The style declaration in the example below tells the browser to display the body content in 14 pixel Arial font on screen, 
    but in the case of print it will display it in Timespoint font at 12 points. But line-height , the value of both properties is set to 1.2:

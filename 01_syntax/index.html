    CSS syntax
    â€‹In this tutorial, you will learn how to define CSS rules in a style sheet, 
    you can style HTML elements through CSS properties. Different HTML elements may have different CSS properties that 
    can be set. CSS properties can be organized into CSS rules. A CSS rule groups together a set of CSS properties and 
    applies all properties to HTML elements matched by the CSS rule.

<!-- 
    Understand CSS syntax
    A CSS style sheet consists of a set of rules that are interpreted by a web browser and then applied to 
    the corresponding elements in the document, such as paragraphs, headings, etc.
 -->

<!-- 
    CSS rules have two main parts, a selector and one or more declarations:
    The selector specifies which element in the HTML page the CSS rule applies to.

    The declaration inside the block determines how the element is formatted on the web page. 
    Each declaration consists of 
        a property and a value separated by 
        a colon ( :) and 
        terminated by a semicolon ( ;), and 
        groups of declarations are enclosed in curly braces {}.

    This property is the style property you want to change. 
    They can be fonts, colors, backgrounds, etc. 
    Each property has a value, for example the color property can have value blueor #0000FFetc.
